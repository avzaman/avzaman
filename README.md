# Well Howdy
Welcome to my github profile. My name is Amir Zaman, most call me Vince though.

### ðŸ§© [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/avzaman/) ðŸ§©

My projects tend to cover a wide variety of technologies as I experiment with stuff new to me! Currently I've created a:
- *social media platform* built with **PHP** and a **MongoDB** NoSQL database, deployed to **AWS**
- *AI model pipeline* that uses **computer vision** and **diffusion** to segment tumor masks from ultrasounds
- *high performance sorting algorithm* that **parallelizes** **quicksort** and **mergesort** in **C** using the OpenMP library
- *data mining analysis* on US Utility data and US Census data, **generating visuals** and **modifying data frames** with **python**
