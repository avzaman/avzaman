## Kean University
#### *Code Samurai Tutor*
[***Website***](https://yoda.kean.edu/~samurai/)<br>
As a code samurai tutor I helped students understand object oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, and operating systems concepts.<br>
I also helped get students connected to the school VPN and deploy their projects to the university's servers, plus other administrative duties.
