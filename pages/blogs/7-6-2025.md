# Exploring Privacy and taking the PewDiePie Pill
What and exhaserbated title!<br>
So recently I've gotten some youtube algorithmic suggestions to watch two particular [PewDiePie](https://www.youtube.com/@PewDiePie/videos) videos. PewDiePie is a youtuber who got extremely famous on the platform from playing horror games, the channel then turned into him making whatever videos about whatever he felt like. I haven't watched him in years, but I do watch programming content regularly which presumably is why these two videos of interest showed up in my feed over the past couple months:
1. [I installed Linux (and so should you)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVI_smLgTY0&t=884s)
2. [I'm DONE with Google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_Lxkt50xOg)

In the first he talks about how after getting fed up with Adobe's absurd subscription policies he started his *"open source journey"*. This led to him pivoting off the typical Windows home user/gamer PC setup to two Linux computers. One with Mint and another (more noteably) Arch. For both computers he goes on about how fun the process of learning the tools was and raving about having near complete control on what his computers do.<br>
The second video continues this sentiment, taking the next step. He explains how he doesn't like google's privacy practices and their fees. Then goes into how that led to him creating a "simple" self hosted home cloud. To a newbie, the things he sets up in the video (file storage, password storage, TV interface, etc.) can seem quite involved and intimidating to replicate. And the reasons he gives of privacy and cost savings may not offset the "immense" effort it looks to build. However, the knowledge gained from this experience is invaluable and I don't think he realizes that many Junior IT proffessionals, or even people with IT Bachelor's degrees, do not have this level of experience with linux labbing! At some point I want to explore why that is. For now I'm keeping it personal because I am currently trying to level up my immediate career capital.<br>
Ultimately in this blog I want to answer:
1. What fully is digital privacy?
2. What does keeping my data private really do for me?
2. How feesable is it for *me* to keep my data as private as possible?

In the end I want to wrap up with my next steps. PewDiePie makes it look very cool, and he references communities of people that do this regularly. It's very easy to say "oh that's so cool I just pivot my whole digital life to a self serving one and it will be so cool and fun." However, I have a history in troubleshooting technical issues and doing large scale technical projects. I know how quickly it can become just frustrating. Consequently it becomes an easy project to drop because there is no real consequence, just lack of discipline. That is whyn I am goinbg through this exercise of reseearching privacy thoroughly. Even though I have my Security+ it can be easy to weigh convenience over privacy.

## What is digital privacy?
So according to the [Institure of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)](https://digitalprivacy.ieee.org/publications/topics/what-is-digital-privacy-and-its-importance/) digital privacy is "Digital privacy, a subset of the broader concept of privacy, focuses on the proper handling and usage of sensitive data—specifically personal information, communication, and conduct".<br>
To prefice my own explination I need to define what "you data" is. This isn't limited to Personally Identifiable Information like birth date, SSN, driver's license number, but also images, videos, documents, code, literally any byte of data that is yours. Now there is also data that you may not own that can be used to identify you. For example code you have written for some business you were employed in. That kind of "your data" you may be less liable, but it's likely you still hold a certain level of responsibility, whether that be to protect yourself or the business. This applies to both stored data and data in motion like them dms.<br>
Now, in my own terms, privacy is ensuring "your data" can only be accessed by those whom you want to access it. That is simple and broad, but captures the ultimate goal of **MY BYTES MY PrECIOUS STAY AWAY!!!**

## What does keeping my data private do for me?
Here is my pre-research understanding:<br>
Keeping info that can be used for identity theft (ie. SSN, drivers license number) needs to be very very secret as it causes a great amount of personal harm, and can easily harm others who know me via impersonation. Info that is "public" or found if someone just googles enough (email, phone number, home address) *sound* unsettling, but the only ultimate consequence is target phishing and ads. Now a bad actor could use that to impersonate me on some level, and AI is making them more convincing these days. But, where I lose track of the turbo privacy nerds is these big tech companies like Google and Facebook tracking your online info. In a workplace I understand the need to takes steps to mitigate this as most business activity needs to remain secret for liability issues, but personally if google knows what games I play on my computer, or what websites I go to, who cares *shrug emoji*? It's very much:<br>
My home activity and business activity are isolated and I'm not doing anything illegal and I don't have any intellectual property where, if stolen, I could lose out big time. I feel like I am the average online user in this case, maybe slightly ascew because I study this stuff, but that is in understanding, not behavior. So why are so many people making stink about their email being in a data breach when it's already on some job board somewhere, or a deviantart account or something?<br><br>
From the same IEEE article:<br>
"The importance of digital privacy is profoundly evident in today’s data-driven world. Individuals utilize digital platforms for various tasks, generating substantial amounts of personal data that could convey intimate insights about their lives if misused—whether it’s sensitive financial information or personal health records. Therefore, digital privacy is crucial as it maintains a boundary to protect users from unwanted intrusions and manipulations of data, preserving human dignity and individual autonomy.

Equally deserving of attention is the role of digital privacy in ensuring a healthy democratic society. It allows the freedom of thought and expression, promoting diversity of ideas and opinions while negating manipulative influences. Within the business sphere, digital privacy practices foster customer trust and build corporate reputation, which are indispensable elements for growth and success in a competitive marketplace.

Finally, digital privacy is pivotal in circumventing potential data breaches. With cybercriminal activities on the rise, ensuring an individual’s digital privacy is not just desirable, but a vital necessity. The threats posed by malicious hackers and cybercriminals make the protection of personal data of utmost importance, thereby emphasizing the imperative need for digital privacy."

Long quote, I know. Cyberstalking and democratic manipulation are two big points that I don't think about often, but after reading some it's easy to see the consequences. If someone were to physcally stalk me I would be majorly unsettling. Digital styalking doesn't seem as bad, but a lot of harm can be done via slander or identity theft or phishing/adjacent phishing by going after firneds and family. Also this can be a stepping stone to personal stalking. Now democratic manipulation is a crazy one. Because of your online habits you can be target with certain advertisements or suggested videos (like on YouTube and TikTok) that sway you in the political direction of whoever that platform wants to associate with. And I'm no psychologist, but I'm sure there's ways to do this subtly so their behavior doesn't seem malicious.

Plus with AI using my data as training info for the model can have it's own consequences. I saw a youtube short the other day by [albertatech](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ARIt2684fiM) really opened my eyes. She explains how you're prompts used as training data can be used by attackers to get personal info. I don't use chatGPT as a therapist, but I have asked it for recipies and stuff and resume help so I'm sure there's some measure of personal data in that thing.

What I don't think I give enough credit to is the legislation behind data privacy, which leads to my large misunderstanding of how digitally private I should be. Now this weekend I don't intend to read tyhrough a plethora of privacy law documents, but just reading the titles aggregated by [epic.org](https://epic.org/issues/privacy-laws/united-states/) you can infer the type of nefarious shit entities want may to do with your data. So becaues of this I haven't felt any consequences from my lack of care... *yet*.

[Here's a YouTube video by Reject Convenience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX3JT6q3AxA) that really convinced me of the need for privacy of individuals. Now I'm a big fan of the whole channel, the dude stands for the whole thing I'm addressing in this blog!

## So what can/should I do?
I am a big social-media hater, it serves only to destroy the lives of it's users and I find them a miserable place. So I have minimized my involvement with these. Also I have become an AI hater (at least the commonly known LLM's, machine learning is awesome and can be super useful, but this big-tech commercial use is , once again, to the detriment of humanity) especially with AI art. Working with technology in an engineering way very much scratches that problem-solving itch. However, as a consumer I feel disgusting. Advertising that treats everyone as equally brainwashable and dim, planned obselencense, everything is as a service, not having any ownership rights to the software you pay for!!!!<br>

This is all to say I am now on board with PewDiePie lol. I agree with his sentiment of software always trying to grab your attention, sell stuff to you, and treat you like you're stupid. So what's the plan moving forward?<br>

First I'm going to wipe any more social-media-like accounts that I can find. Then I did some research on replacing the essential functions of my phone so I can transition to a dumby phone. I will share this spreadsheet in a later blog after I make the switch. Managing my computer behavior is going to be a big challenge as well which I will explore after I'm free from the hellscape thast has become smartphones. It's unfortuante that such a useful tool is being used against humanity.<br>

I may have to purchase a newwer phone capable of 4g, but I'm not sure if that has to do with cell service or just internet connection. Need to research that more as well. Here are some old phones my parents had kept that I yoinked to check out. And can I just say: what the hell happened to phone design, they used to have such a personality!! (That's probably just my modern day ass retro hype glazing, they were proabaly shrug emoji at the time lol)<br>

Thanks for sitting down, let me know if this resonates or if youn think this is silly stupid mode.
