- macbook for new year girlfriend made me make a tictacto game in under an hour to get dinner
- setting up github and ssh pain in my booty
    - generating keys cuz ssh poggers https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent
    - permission denied and garbage!!! turns out different terminal need to start agent everytime will need to make solution, I thinkj running a script with a little idle animtion to denote this is my git terminal window https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18404272/running-ssh-agent-when-starting-git-bash-on-windows
    - ssh key nomenclature https://gist.github.com/ChristopherA/3d6a2f39c4b623a1a287b3fb7e0aa05b
    - restart ssh agent https://www.baeldung.com/linux/ssh-agent-restart-no-relogin
- what I would like for home server:
    - vpn
    - content blocker
    - media storage and player
    - bimonthly backups (eventually of certain machine config files in case I fry one of my devices) -> this is now like a NAS thing maybe if I wanna backup specific files on the network
    - redundancy and security (this is the new goal of the above point)
- Step One: Machine Setup
    - power supply troubleshooting
    - installing OS
    - installing drivers installed a desktop and which enabled the thing to go to sleep!!!!

        - https://documentation.ubuntu.com/server/how-to/graphics/install-nvidia-drivers/
- Step Two: ssh
    - setting a static ip
- Step Three Part 1: Wireguard
    - gonna do wiregaurd cuz fast
    - home dynamic ip from ISP, create a nameserver dns record and just update the ip every month or so
    - came across this reddit thread where a commentor gave mne the idea of being like "oh yeah screw these ddns services" https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/wk5v9o/what_are_better_alternatives_of_noip/
    - use whoer.net to find my ip lol (in testing this I try to use tracepath to verify but tracing beyond the router only shows the incoming port's ip, but putting in the whoer adr returns 1 hop)
    - the script this article refers to seems to simplify the wiregaurd config https://peterries.net/blog/wireguard-on-ubuntu/ (weird for wiregaurd exclaiming how simple it is)
    - on the wiregaurd wiki it says that the server can have any ip but peers have defined ips even though the peer is the thing that should be able to connect from anywhere??????
    - can't just curl the script so sftp'd, I always thought it was one command, but it's actually has it's own cli whioch im kinda like hermmmm shrug emoji
    - eventually migrate to registrar that will allow me to interact with domain pointer settings via api to automate changing the ip addr
    - actually just need an a record to point to subdomain, it should send all traffic there not just http, but we'll see
    - holy gorsh I spent literally an entire day futzing around with useless tool like bmon trying to troubleshoot and working around kernel protection to put the wireguard debugs into dmesg
    - NEEDED TO ENABLE FIREWALL
    - called with ISP their provided modems don't allow vpn tunnels? so I juist get second hand modem router
    - tcpdump is the tool i've been needing looking for need to confirm my suspicions!!! no traffic hitting the server, my packets are not getting forwarded!!!!

        - https://www.reddit.com/r/WireGuard/comments/1c5jrzn/maybe_its_a_handshake_failure_issue/
- Step Three Part 2: OpenVPN
    - yoinked router no longer used by parents that's not v old, flashed firmware update and got isp to bridge modem
    - way more granular control, want to try maybe loading opensense onto it at some point, comes with OpenVPN and pptp integration so imma try that shinan instead of forwarding to server
    - after adding a dns server to router settings and hacing the static ip address set WITHIN THE DHCP RANGE?????? then pinging worked
    - now server is recieving stuff from the peer, but the handshake does not complete so I think there is an issue recieving on client end (been testing with Verizon phone, will try test with just another person's network and on computer not iphone, when starting tunnel on own network was able to access lan but not internet so I think that has to do with Verizon NAT or summ)

-Step Four: Pi Holer
    - substep = docker cuz I wanna be a container bro from the container store and learn yaml and docker cuz that's the hotness of ioc an automating putting up whole ass systems
    - installing docker is sussly involved, but is gucci
    - once I resolveed the port 53 being junked up pi hole just runs and runs good, set dns to the home server and we gtg
    - this is where I'm like I should grab a network card at some point for this thing if im tryna run a bunch of services, and what if theres many web ui's!!! I need to sort out port stuff!!!!
    - btw firefox uses their own dns fucko boingo shit that will fuck up ur pihole for just that browser so gotta disable

        - https://www.reddit.com/r/pihole/comments/l8vwnx/does_mozilla_firefox_overrides_my_pihole/
- Step Five: RAID
    - installing ubuntu there was an optionb for software raid but was like "I am not gonna deal with that nonsense right meow"
    - talking with boss he mentioned that motherboard can do raid and I was like wooah (I usually think of board raid in context of servers at work)
    - "dmidecode -t 2" command gives precisley motherboard... and mine supports RAID: MPG Z490 GAMING PLUS , so how to get into bios: Delete key , so weirdge so upsetty slammy my f-keys
    - tried hardware RAID and after restarting several times and trying software RAID after accidentally wiping the server it turns out the secondary drive I installed had pooped out on me
    - had another (smaller) drive lying around and I set up the motherboard raid successfully and this time installed ubunutu with and encryptrewd lvm (drippy hungy face emoji hehehe)
    - now I redo installing docker and pi hole!!!! that one's on me for not makin a backer upper

# Year Linux desktop?? No, year of the self hoster!!
Yes, you heard it here first folk, we sprinted through the meat and into the grinder! Yes, I have been having much fun setting up my *dotfile* and me *configs* but that's a much less shareable story and more of a shareable cookie. I have cooking up something far more *"it's about the journey not the destination"* flavored!

First, let me provide context of how focused I was on doing computer activities over the winter break: 

My girlfriend was making dinner a few weeks ago. Specifically, a meal I especially enjoy she makes. My *favorite* **meal**. She sets the stove to do it's idle work for a bit and plops next to me and starts askin' me 'bout certain somehows with my programming skills.

Don't get me wrong here I've studied long and hard and am going to study longer and harder. This has led me to pick up programming raw style pretty decently, but I'm not exactly privy to putting together a gui or inverted binary tree or operating system or other what-have-yous without some time and handy-man man-handing research. However comma, when the misses said this next statement I beamed confidence and HASTE. She asks me

"Could you program a tic tac toe game in under an hour?"

"Oh why yes I can I can blast that no problem," mind you the *bottom text* to this question was *"you get chicken when you finish making that game"* so I was high hammin' my keyboard. After fumbling to decide on a language I just made a java file because however wordy it is, it's what I am most familiar with. After 42ish minutes I produced the crummiest, most dirt cheap, most stupid AI as an oponent text based version of tic tac toe you will ever have the pleasure of viewing below.

```
```

So yeah I was pushing pixels this winter and I want to talk about my adventures in setting up my first home server and the first few services I wanted to serve myself via...
