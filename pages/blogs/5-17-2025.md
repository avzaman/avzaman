# There and Back Again, A Networking Story
Not actually *back* or *again*, but I like the call beack heh heh heh...<br>
Alrighty!! Hello once again audience, this week I started the **HOME LAB EXTRAVAGANZA**!!
## What's the heck is going on here??!!
So if you've been keepin up so far (*oh I know you have wink plus smile*) then you would know that I studying for the CCNA exam to become a fully qualified network engineer type lad. Knowing how to build software is all well and good, but I like understanding how the crap works behind the behind the scenes. You know, like to a regular ah user using a software like *steamclient.exe* they don't <ins>know how the logic works</ins> and how the computer knows to do what and what deals to give the store and how to generate what text needs to go where in your game library or profile or whatever wherever. But as a computer scientist we can <ins>infer a lot of that logic</ins> and be like *"hmmmm they must grep for that info, like query some sorta database with the games on it and it's formatted in some sort of json that is parsed locally and then uses some sort of UI framework that talk with the operating system to create a window for the program and display back at me what games I own and have installed and so on and so forth."* That inferencing power is baller and how stuff gets over the web has always mysstified me a similar way that software has. So getting this cert, and **creating a home lab** aims to arm me with the similar knowledge I have unto software and programming now.<br>
*Another* note on bmy behavior (my behaavior being that Im crafting a home lab) is that I've seen many-a post on LinkedIn recently, algorithm selecting me to see many other students and their home labs. Plus [the book I am using to study](https://www.amazon.com/CCNA-200-301-Official-Guide-Library/dp/0138221391/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1) (I highly recommend it if you're CCNA-ing yourself) talks about crafting home labs all the time. So... here I am, hat in da ring.  
## The Equipment
GEAR UP AND ROLL OUT!<br>
So I've got some cutesy little access to few old ah dino ah switchasauruses. Some Hewlit Packard type beat. An HP V1920-G24 (G24 for 24 gigabit ports), an HPE Office Connect 1920, and a HP V1910-48G. All of which required a factory reset of which has been a pain in my goose to remedy. The solution is to plug both ends of an etherent cable into ports 1 and 2 and just wait and eventually it figures it out (grimmacing emoji)ðŸ˜¬. I also have a Sonic Wall firewall, but I'm starting out with a simple topology to get the nag of things first. Here's the lil setup:<br>

Now I also have some wird ah cable any none network engineer would probably never had heard of called a rollover cable. This requires and adapter. Sadly I could not get this ancient thing to work because you can't plug it right into you're computers reular 'ol ethernet port because of the pinouts **AND** the driver software for the dapter is ancient. [Here's what the driver-download website looks like](https://www.vigorelectronics.com/downloads.html) for the company that made this adapter back 1985. Yeesh! Anyhoo, I did something else to edit the config I'll get into later. Here's what the cable looks like tho:<br>

#### A teensy weensy bit of networking
To explain that pinout thing I just mentioned, there a really three kinds of common pinouts you'll see on the end an ethernet cable via what is called an RJ45 port (that's the plasit bit with the clippy on). There is *straight-through* which has the ordering:<br>
A A B C C B D D<br>
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8<br>
TO<br>
A A B C C B D D<br>
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8<br>
Where each letter corresponds to one circuit loop (aka a Pair). For straight through, both ends of the cable are the same.<br>
*Cross-over* cables have this pairing:
A A B C C B D D<br>
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8<br>
TO<br>
A A B C C B D D<br>
2 1 6 5 4 3 8 7<br>
This is much better explained with an image:<br>
![image of crossover and straight through](/assets/img/blog/5-17-2025/straight-cross.jpg)<br>
Now these two pinouts don't matter too much these days because modern switches/routers/pcs/whatever are equipped with something called ***Auto-MDIX*** which is a protocol that allows the two devices on either end to figure out how to send bits over the link propperly. Generally; routers->switches, pc's->switches, routers->hubs, pc's to hubs require a straight through. Whereas router->routers, pc's->routers, switches->switches, etc require crossover because in pins expect inny info and nothing in their outy. But nowadays that's all moot. **EXCEPT** for the the *rollover-poinout* cables!!! Of which you will likey not encounter too often. Here is the diagram of the pinout:<br>

This lad <ins>cannot</ins> be auto-mdix'd. Do not use him! Unless you wanna do some cutesy console stuff.
## The first Network Diagram
So just to start, I want to use all three switches so I have a parent switch that acts as a **bridge betwixt two worlds!!!** This will allow me to toy with vlans better and once I have more than just mine and my girlfriend's laptops I can sus out more endpoints. Later I would like to get that firewall involved and a router or two if I can get my *grubby lil mits* on one.<br>
![image of diagram](/assets/img/blog/5-17-2025/NetworkDiagram1.jpg)<br>
The plan is to have *Luna* and *Phobos* on different subnets and vlans, then have *Deimos* layer 3 switch mode route between the vlans. If I can grab a couple more endpoints I can mess with trunking! Plus I'd like to try a more radial design so I can mess up the spanning tree nonesense.
## Some CLI for the Hewlit Packard
So I am big sad mode I couldn't get the consol to function all nice like this week. I will have to order a newer serial adaptor ðŸ™ƒ. Now to try and <br>
So I am stuck using the normie ah way to get into these things (I would like to nerd out please). *HOWEVER* comma, I found that telnet **AND** SSH (the freakin secure one!) had been disabled. I had to add the route to my pc's routing table manually with the outbound port ip adress of my ethernet port because I need internet to look crap up so I can't disable my wifi adapter in the meantime!! Here's the command for that:
```
route add <switch ip address> mask <255.255.255.255 for just the one address> if <interface number>
```
To get the interface number you can't just use ipconfig you'll need to query wmi directly:
```
get-netadapter
```
After some fiddling around in the console I turned to the browser and low-and-behold freakin raw http no s is enabled:<br>
![screenshot of browser working but not terminal](/assets/img/blog/5-17-2025/sadhttp.jpg)<br>
So now I have to factory reset these jawnathans Even though the ip addresses are default, the login credentials aren't. *Something I really should have started with*. The sucky thing is there is no clear way to do this, no "reset" buttun in the back of a tiny hold you need a paperclip to reach, no, NONE OF THAT NONESENSEN NOT HERE!! After some *research* ðŸ˜Ž I found [in order to reset the configuration](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/2fvrw3/psa_you_can_reset_your_hp_v1910_switch_to_factory/) of the switch you must plug in both ends of an ethernet cable in the first two ports and then leave it powered on for an arbitrary amount of time??????? Like excuse me, sorry for wanting to *lab it up* shirt brother. [The manual](https://support.hpe.com/hpesc/public/docDisplay?docId=c02965327&docLocale=en_US) doesn't have anything on factory resetting from outside the config consol...<br>
After waiting for a few hours, the configs don't seem to have reset to factory default, or some other issue because the ip addressers reset but ssh is still disabled and the default username password does not work. I even had to [wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html) probe the out my ethernet port to grab the new ip via arp because the switch did not reset to the 169 ip on the label, but some 192.168 nonesense ðŸ¤§. So what Imma do is get a serial cable and see if I can't get online with that. Sometimes gotta end the seession on an L... Keep ya posted
## Thank you!! bye bye <3!! hehehehehe 
Y'all cute, keep up the great work!<br>
