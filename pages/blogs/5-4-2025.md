# LOOK AT THIS WINDOWS 95 AH WEBSITE!! ‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è
*So...*<br>
Welcome back to the show everyone, I'm your host **Vince** and you'll have noticed that this bi-week's episode is rather lacking in the punctual department (only by a day, but who's counting). This time crunch is coarsly due to the fact I had to coordinate moving of my living situation this week and am glad to report a sucecssful operation as I sit at my desk to write this, boxes stacked around me like im a flesh Empire State Building in the downtown of cardboard Manhatten! *Anywayyy...*<br>
I at least had some time in the previous week to spruce up this website. Citing the aformentioned title of the blog-post we notice I went for a turn of the century, classy, sort of timeless piece. However, looking at it with conccurrent eye it's giving more twentieth century, art-deco, rebelious. As in I'm planning to rebel against modern Windows distributions to future proof myself from *The Man* by installing a linux distro onto my PC. I digress:
### Why 95
I needed a look that wasn't as complex as my ideal profolio. Something without copious animations with demanding frontend scripts (of which I have limited to no knowledge on how to write). Windows 95 is a pog-rich retro ah look that reminices on a time less associated with bloatware and pastels and more neons and nerd font icons. To support this I turned to **[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)** to deploy the damn thing, a light JS framework for creating static websites quickly. I needed a framework and not just a bunch of html pages because I wanted to reuse the headers and footers. PHP includes are simple if you're not deploying through netlify or whatever else where you need a whole configuration theme park rather than just a JSON at the front gate saying "üßçHey yeah just like 'npm 11ty' that *jawnathan* and you're good brother yeah have a good day.üßç"
### .md üòâ
More critical to eleventy is it's support to compose html responses from trnasforming **markdown**(.md) content into html and injecting that junk right into the Aorta of a **nunjucks**(.njk) file. My understanding of .njk is that it's a file format used primarily in JS frameworks to do light scripting in the lines and to reference other content to put in place in lines. Very limited. But I have been avoiding proompt engineering at all costs because these projects are strcitly for my satisfaction so if I don't learn and create then the payoff of having a cool site wont give that yummy dopamine hit.
### The cornicopius of the thing
So the main sitch of getting this look close to that 95 was the big blue bar on the top of the window, the nav bar, and the content box.<br>
**The nav and the blue bar** both sit in the header. The way flex-box works allows me to encompass both parts of the header into seperate *&lt;div&gt;*'s and then align all those vertically while flexboxing the stuff within each to go horizontal! This creates weird psuedo-grid thingy, but a LOT simpler than grid. Flex-box spooked me at first because building a website seemed like alot (even for a CS grad like myself), but you don't need a framework or some fancy garbo crumbo, just rawdawg that css!!! [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1FeOOhNnwU) by EdRoh really cleared up the whole placing-things-where-they-ought-to-be issue for me. And [here is a link](https://yoksel.github.io/flex-cheatsheet/) to the flex-box tool he uses to also experiment and grasp how each super and subclass gets affected by the css. Here is what my üí∏*reusable*üí∏ header file looks like:
```
<header class="bg-gray-800 text-white">
    <div class="appicon">
        <div id="topwrapper"><img src="/assets/img/top.ico" ><span>Portfolio</span></div>
        <div id="xwrapper"><span>X</span></div>
    </div>
    <div class="hero">
        <img class="heroimg" src="/assets/img/hero.jpg">
        <div class="contacts">
            <h1>/Amir Vincent Zaman/&gt;_</h1>
            <div>avzaman2020@outlook.com</div>
            <div>Somerville, NJ</div>
            <div>B.S. Computer Science</div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="nav">
        <div class="pages">
            <div class="page"><a href="/index/">Resume</a></div>
            <div class="page"><a href="/pages/blog/">Blog</a></div>
            <div class="page"><a href="/pages/credentials/">Credentials</a></div>
            <div class="page"><a href="/pages/work/">Work</a></div>
            <div class="page"><a href="/pages/projects/">Projects</a></div>
            <div class="page"><a href="/pages/community/">Community</a></div>
        </div>
    </div>
</header>
```
And this is the corresponding CSS. As you can see, the wrappers make flexing this stuff easy for when screens go stretchy or squishy:
```
    /***********/
    /* HEADER */
    /***********/
    header {
        background-color:#bdbdbd;
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column;
        justify-content: flex-start;
        align-items:stretch;
    }
    .appicon{
        padding:10px;
        margin:0;
        background:2px #bdbdbd;
        font-size:26px;
        background-color:#0b00a6;

        display:flex;
        flex-direction:row;
        justify-content:space-between;
    }
    #topwrapper{
        color:white;
        display:flex;
    }
    #topwrapper span{
        padding-left:10px;
    }
    #xwrapper{
        font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;
        padding-left:3px;
        padding-right:3px;
        border-style:outset;
        border-width: 3px;
        border-color:#dbdbdb;
        background-color: #bdbdbd;
    }


    /*personal info area*/
    .hero {
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: row;
        flex-wrap:wrap;
        justify-content: flex-start;
        margin:5px;
    }

    .heroimg {
        height: auto;
        flex-basis: 20px;
        width: 150px;
    }

    .contacts {
        color:black;
        padding-left:10px;
    }

    /*nav area*/
    .pages {
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: row;
        flex-wrap:wrap;
        justify-content:flex-start;
        background-color: #bdbdbd;
        border-style:outset;
        border-width: 3px;
        border-bottom-width:0px;
        border-right-width:0;
        border-left-width:0px;
        border-color:#dbdbdb;
        /* border-style:outset;
        border-width:5px;
        border-color:lightgrey; */
    }
    .page {
        border-style:outset;
        border-width: 3px;
        border-color:#dbdbdb;
        background-color: #bdbdbd;
        color:black;
        padding: 5px;
    }
    a:link, a:visited{
        padding:2px;
        border-style:dashed;
        border-width: 1px;
        border-color:#bdbdbd;
        color: black;
        text-decoration: none;
    }
    a:hover, a:active{
        border-style:dashed;
        border-width: 1px;
        border-color:black;
        color:black;
        text-decoration: none;
    }
```
**The content area** just has an inset border with a nice color for the background often seen in windows 95 (I know because I googled what windows 95 looked like hehehehe). But to get a better understanding here is the .njk that takes in the header, foot, and content to blend it all together and spit out a friendly response!
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8"/>
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"/>
        <link rel="icon" href="{{ '/assets/img/favicon.ico' | url }}" type="image/x-icon">
        <title>{{ title }}</title>
        <!-- This comes from the page's front matter -->
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/styles/styles.css"/>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="bgwrapper">
            {% include "header.njk" %}
            <!-- shared header -->
            <main>
                {{ content | safe }}
                <!-- this is where the page's content goes -->
            </main>
            {% include "footer.njk" %}
            <!-- shared footer -->
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
```
All of my portfolio site code can be fond on [my github <3](https://github.com/avzaman) (which I will link soon to the portfolio itself heh).

### Thank you bye bye <3
I tabled the topic I wanted to talk about because of the move, but that's alright!!<br>
Until next 2 week<br>
