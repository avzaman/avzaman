## <ins>Networking Home Lab</ins>
[***Blog Post***](/pages/blog/)<br>
Fueled by my curiosity of how other layers of the network handle the information I'm **transferring** in my applications, I've been crafting a home lab with a few old refurbished switches, a firewall, and a few endpoints.  
Experimenting with **security features** and **scalability**, I've been learning a lot in preparation for the **CCNA** exam.

## <ins>"V" Social Media Site Clone of X (Formerly Twitter)</ins>
[***GitHub Repo***](https://github.com/avzaman/AvzamanSocial)<br>
[***Live App***](https://d173s6iimxj6sw.cloudfront.net/AvzamanSocial/social-feed.php)<br>
For an independent study on **NoSQL databases**, I decided to create a project to back (and track haha) my knowledge.  
With the focus being on getting used to **CRUD** and *system design*, I used a web scripting language I am mostly familiar with: **PHP**.  
Contrary to popular belief, **PHP** is still quite powerful and bridges web-based languages from **Java** better than **JavaScript** does (which is weird â€” it's in the name, isn't it?).  
Either way, I made a **Twitter clone**; the main missing core feature is the ability to follow and unfollow people, tailoring the user experience.  
However, throughout the project I got to learn about *web design*, **NoSQL**, and **AWS deployments**.

## <ins>Tumor Ultrasound Semi-Supervised Segmentation</ins>
[***GitHub Repo***](https://github.com/avzaman/UltrasoundDiffusion)<br>
For my graduating project in my last semester at Kean University, I worked with my professor Kuan Huang to **develop** a more efficient method for segmenting tumors in ultrasound images.  
Tumors need to be segmented because the shape and size of tumors can expedite diagnosis!  
The problem is there is so little labeled data. So what we did to resolve this was use the **Mean Teacher** training method.  
This method is **semi-supervised** instead of fully supervised, meaning not all the images need labels. It uses two models, a *student* and a *teacher*, where the teacher is trained with labeled data and guides the learning of the student model.  
Now, where do we get our unlabeled images? **Diffusion**. I used the **Medifusion** project (found in the GitHub summary of this project) to create *synthetic ultrasound data*!

## <ins>Utility Disparity Analysis</ins>
[***GitHub Repo***](https://github.com/avzaman/UtilityRateDisparity)<br>
This is a **National Science Foundation (NSF)** funded research project I worked on and presented at the **Great Minds in STEM (GMiS)** conference, where I won 3rd place in the *Math Sciences Research* competition.  
It is a detailed analysis of not only the most recent (and albeit thin) **utility rate data**, but also how it compares to **U.S. Census** data such as *income* and *demographics*.  
I worked to uncover unusual patterns by **normalizing**, **visualizing**, and **correlating** the datasets using *Python-based tools*.

## <ins>Parallelized Sorting Algorithms</ins>
[***GitHub Repo***](https://github.com/avzaman/ParallelSorting)<br>
My first independent research endeavor at Kean University was to supply an initial project on the new **HPC system** the school had purchased.  
I worked on **parallelizing algorithms** familiar to me and other students for demonstration purposes.  
Sorting algorithms are well known and covered early in the curriculum, so seeing **merge-sort** and **quick-sort** implemented in parallel would be a handy tool to showcase what the **CPU clusters** could do.  
Using the **C programming language** kept performance tight and close to the hardware, and the *divide-and-conquer* approach to the algorithms made for seamless integration.  
Using **cron jobs**, I generated benchmarks of sorting different sized arrays with different allocated cores, then supplied *visualizations* (viewable on the GitHub page).

## <ins>Advent of Code</ins>
[***GitHub Repo***](https://github.com/avzaman/AdventOfCode)<br>
[***Website***](https://adventofcode.com/)<br>
**Advent of Code** comes about every year in December. From December 1st to the 25th, there are 2 **coding challenges** (similar to a **LeetCode** problem) every day that ask you to compute an output for a given input.  
Usually the inputs are far too large to solve by hand, but as long as you get your unique generated output, you pass!  
I use this time to learn a new **technology** and just have fun with a different format of programming challenges that isn't LeetCode or HackerRank.  
Sometimes I optimize **algorithms**, sometimes I "optimize" by **overclocking** my computer, or forcing **GPU operations** with **CUDA**.  
Either way, it's a fun time of year for programmers and I *implore others to join*!
