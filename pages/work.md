## <ins>Hudson Community Enterprises<ins>
### *IT Support Specialist*
**January 2025 - Present**<br><br>
At Hudson I resolve end user tickets as well as set up and maintain all parts of the IT infrastructure. Here is a list of projects I have led while there:

- Developed low-to-no cost solution for administrating IT for non-profits remotely with the use of different cloud and open source technologies. This includes Remote Monitoring and Management, authentication solutions, and security policy enforcement. This involved working with Docker containers, configuring public and local DNS, orchestrating services to run on different operating systems in the same domain, and a lot of documentation sifting.
- Launched Wazuh SIEM server and connected agents from all workstations and servers for continuous security monitroing and auditing. To accomplish this I utilized much documentation, my working knowledge of linux, and Windows GPO software deployment methods. 
- Brokered a new client for the business (we are an IT MSP for non-profits) and handled the migration of assets.
- Handled large-scale upgrading of Windows 10 PC's to Windows 11. This involved taking a detailed inventory (automated using Powershell). This saved the business a lot of money in hardware upgrades because I aggregated the information to perform hard drive swaps so LTSC versions could run on older hardware.
- Set up 2 new office locations with network equipment (switches, cable routing, DC, firewall) making sure the location was accessible and neat.
- Took inventory of harware and negotiated with vendors a low-cost and secure method of tech recycle and hard drive destruction. This cleared up a lot of space in the offices and server closets making general operations a lot smoother.
- Audit the security of a legacy webapp built in C#. I went through the process of hardening both the server and code based on OWASP best practices.

And these are on top of handling the day-to-day like fixing scanners (there are a lot of scanners), upgrading older servers, gauging users' experience with the current tech setup, and so on.

## <ins>Kean University<ins>
### *Teaching Assistant*
**March 2023 - January 2025**<br><br>
At Kean I got the chance to tutor students from all walks of life on math and computer science topics. From stats to calc to operating systems to databases. I learned a lot myself while getting to meet new people. These are additional responsibilities I had:

- Ran group learning sessions to reinforce topics covered during main course meeting times. Using Google Jam Board I would create lesson plans and draw fun characters to help my peers understand programming concepts better. 
- Represented the Tutoring Center at campus events to make students aware of our services. I got to be my vibrant friendly self and get students comfortable coming to the library and seaking help when they need it.
- Help ESL students get accustomed to campus during a 4 week summer course. I helped them get familiar with Kean University systems (registering for classes, class portals, etc.). I assistand a bilingual professor in teaching them english. I like to draw so I used whiteboard drawings in the morning to drive engagement!

During my time at Kean I made many friends, both coworkers and students needing help. While teaching I really got to reinforce my own working knowledge of what I learned at Kean!

## <ins>T-Red Properties<ins>
### *Information Technology Intern*
**May 2018 - May 2020**<br><br>
My time at T-Red properties was split into IT and property management work. This made me become astutely familiar with time management, project planning, and hardware deployment/maintainence. Here are some important experiences I have from T-Red:

- I set up several offices with a full network setup. Running cables from server closets. Setting up the servers themselves with lights-out management and UPS backups. Setting up the firewalls. Ensuring all WAPs had good coverage. The whole nine yards.
- Post flooding basement remediation. I had to assess damages, organize the different vendors that deal with water damage and the issues that with moisture (weakend construction, mold, etc) and negotiate the best prices. I'm primarily interested in the boiler repairing. I identified the circuitboards used on all the water-heaters and replaced/repaired them myself.

I was the tech guy on all job sites so I got the chance to work closesly with all levels of infrastructure.
